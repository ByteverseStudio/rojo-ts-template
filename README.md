# Rojo TS Template Roblox
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.0.0 & [Roblox-TS](https://github.com/roblox-ts/roblox-ts).


## Getting Started with Programming
To work with this project, you must have [foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman), [nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

To installing tools:
